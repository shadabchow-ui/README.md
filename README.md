Artifact: CS250_Sprint_Review_and_Retrospective.docx

This document captures my Sprint Review and Retrospective from the SNHU Travel project. It demonstrates how Agile and Scrum practices such as roles, user stories, communication, and retrospectives were applied throughout development.

Reflection
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by breaking them down into clear, actionable user stories. User stories are valuable because they keep the focus on the user’s perspective rather than just technical tasks. Each story describes who the user is, what they need, and why it matters. This ensures that the features we build directly support the end-user’s goals. Implementing stories incrementally also allows for early feedback, so the program evolves in line with real user needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to development is to break projects into smaller, testable pieces and deliver them iteratively. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives help structure this work, making it easier to adapt to changes. In the future, I want to consistently use practices like maintaining a prioritized backlog, delivering working increments in sprints, and holding retrospectives to identify ways to improve. These Agile processes help teams stay flexible, transparent, and focused on continuous delivery.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means more than writing code—it’s about communication, accountability, and collaboration. Good team members share progress openly, raise blockers early, and help others when possible. They participate actively in Scrum events, give constructive feedback, and respect deadlines. In Agile development, teamwork is what makes iterative cycles successful, and being reliable and engaged ensures the team can deliver value consistently.
